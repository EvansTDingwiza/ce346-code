Project Lab 4: Multi-device Messaging and Coordination
=========

In this lab you will explore how a more powerful user facing computational device (your laptop) can be a useful part of the microcontroller system you are building. Microcontrollers are just one level in the hierarchy of computing we encounter in our daily life, moving data from a real-time MCU to a more powerful device is extremely common. The MSP430 is a real-time device with novel sensors and capability not found in a typical laptop. Moreover, the MSP430 is portable, meaning that it could be worn if the SuperCap or a battery was attached. For our purposes, the two main use cases we may see for connecting the MSP430 with a laptop via a communication channel are Visualization and Control. These are of course often  intermingled.

In two parts, the communication will be handled via wired UART, and wireless UART over Wifi.
